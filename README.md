# Secret Santa (Amigo Invisible) Online

This is an user-friendly, open-source online application for organizing "Secret Santa" events. It allows users to add participants, automatically assign Secret Santas, and send emails to all participants with the details of their Secret Santa.

This application is built with Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, ensuring a modern, efficient, and seamless user experience.
